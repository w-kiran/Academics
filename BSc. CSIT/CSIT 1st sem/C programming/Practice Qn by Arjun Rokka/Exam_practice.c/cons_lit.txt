Constant
1.A constant is a value that cannot be changed during program execution. 
2.Constants are often used to define values that are used repeatedly throughout a program.
3.Constants are typically named using uppercase letters and underscores to separate words. (e.g. HIGH_VALUE).
4.Constants can have different data types, such as interger, float, string ....
5.Constants have a global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.



Literals 
1.A literal is a value that is directly specified in the source code of a program.
2.Literals are used to represent specific value or data types in a program.
3.Literals are not named, as they are specified directly in the code.
4.Literals can also have different data types depending on the value specified (e.g.18 is a integer literal, "Hello" is a string literal).
5.Literals are local to the code block in which they are defined..



We need to define the type of data because it helps to ensure memory efficiency, prevent errors, improve performance and enhance code readability.


Conditional operator is also known as ternary operator which allow you to write compact Conditional expression.
