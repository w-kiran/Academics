It contains child elements <title>, <author>, and <publicationYear>.
Each child element has text content providing information about the book.
This is a basic structure, and XML can be used to represent more complex data with nested
elements and attributes. Remember that XML documents start with a declaration (<?xml
version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>). The declaration specifies the XML version and the
character encoding used in the document.
